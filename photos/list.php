#Required to protect the list!

#Always use the exact name of the folder followed
#by a return key (make sure there's no spaces)

#Blank lines are ignored as well as anything
#starting with a '#' symbol.

#Section heads must be on their own line and
#should start with '*' character
#i.e. *My Heading Goes Here

#Section names can include basic HTML if necessary

#If you have a long list then you could use a list
#command in terminal to build the list
#i.e Windows users use dir /B or pipe it out to a file
#with '>' character. I.e. dir /B > myfolders.txt
#Linux & Mac use ls -1 > myfolders.txt

#emot icons can be used also and a prepacked collection
#is included. Use: <emot class='popo-blacy-amazing'></emot>
